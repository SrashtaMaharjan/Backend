"This spreadsheet was made using a template from Wesleyan University and intends to ensure that all Vassar students are financially stable throughout the covid-19 pandemic. Please share widely to everyone in the Vassar community––students, faculty, staff, parents, alumni, friends, etc. If you have the means, please donate to someone else in the community either through a direct monetary donation or by providing housing or remote work to someone in need. There are several pages on this spreadsheet. The next page organizes direct monetary donations between students. If you are in need of money, please list your name, contact information, and Venmo/paypal/cashapp so that someone can donate to you. If you have the means, PLEASE donate to someone else in the community. Wealthy students: the time for performative class consciousness is up. If you genuinely care about and want to help the low-income and at risk students in our community, it’s time to redistribute your wealth immediately.  The following pages on the spreadsheet organize needs for housing and remote work. Many students relied on Vassar for stable housing and employment; if you are able to offer these things to anyone in the Vassar community, please say so on the spreadsheet.  I hope everyone is staying safe in these scary times. Please isolate yourself as much as possible, wash your hands regularly and sanitize your spaces, check in on loved ones, and take care of yourselves.  Lastly, if you see any problems with the way this spreadsheet is organized or think there is a better way to create this document, please feel free to let me know! You can contact me via Facebook, Twitter, or email at mretta@vassar.edu. This is by no means a perfect solution, I just wanted to create a way for low-income student’s needs to be met as fast as possible. Sending you all the best <3 "
