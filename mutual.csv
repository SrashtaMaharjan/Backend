,,Venmo @Rasu-Neupane,5,"I am an international student supported by my family. My parent’s business had been struggling for the last 9 months and COVID-19 lockdown only made it worse as their business is crippled by the country’s lockdown. Both of my parents cannot go to work due to restrictions that have also stopped all their income sources. They spent a huge deal of their savings trying to save their business during this difficult time and provide for the family at the same time. At this moment, they can only partially assist me with my finances which is why I am having some financial issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
